Ansible role for a Mailserver
=============================

Ansible role to create a Mailserver on OpenBSD (>6.0) with OpenSMTPD, Dovecot, DKIMProxy and Rspamd.

Requirements
------------

OpenBSD, Python 2.7 (on client machine) and 10 minutes.

Notes
-----

This is still a WIP, so far, you need to create DKIM keys, new users and DNS entrys. Also, you need
to enable dovecot, smtpd, rspamd and dkimproxy_{in,out} at boot.

You need to adjust your pf.conf.

Also, you need to delete examples on /etc/mail/virtuals and /etc/mail/domains

Feedback is welcome.
